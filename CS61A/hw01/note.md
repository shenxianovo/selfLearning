- rubber ducking 
When stuck on a problem, try to explain the area in which you are stuck. This doesn’t need to be to
a person who understands how to solve the problem (or even a person! this practice is often referred
to as rubber ducking because you can talk to a rubber duck) because the main goal is for you to
clarify your own thoughts and figure out what exactly is wrong with your understanding or code.
